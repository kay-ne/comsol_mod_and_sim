As stated in the description, this respository contains files from my project for my **Modelling and Simulation in Physics course in Spring 2024** utilising COMSOL. My project was comparing the velocity and pressure of water in a pipe with and without a conical end.

- **Comsol_Files** contains the two files of the pipe with and without a cone end.

- **Project_Results** contains images from both files, pressure (and contour), velocity. There is also an image for the condition of the wall, cone dimensions, and the laminar fluid equation.

- **COMSOL Project Report** is a brief 2-page report that contains details of the project and results. (Physics problem I am solving, relevant constitutive equations, details of geometry, boundary conditions, and how I am using COMSOL to solve the problem).
